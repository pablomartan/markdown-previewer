# markdown-previewer
## About
This is a simple markdown previewer. It's the second project listed to earn the
[freeCodeCamp FEND Tech certification]
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries)

The usage is very simple. It has a text area where you write the Markdown text,
and a preview area which shows the md parsed as HTML. For the parsing it uses
the [Marked library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

## Usage
You will need `node.js` and `npm`. To get them both you can go to
[Node.js](https://node.js.org)'s homepage to download and install them. You
will also need [`git`](https://git-scm.com). Once installed, you can clone this
repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/pablomartan/markdown-previewer
```

Then, inside the directory where you cloned the repository, you will have to
run `npm i` to install node's dependencies, and once done, you can either run
with hot reloading by running `npm start` on your terminal, or run `npm run
build` for production ready code.
