# markdown-previewer
## About
This is a simple markdown previewer. It's the second project listed to earn the
[freeCodeCamp FEND Tech certification]
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries)

The usage is very simple. It has a text area where you write the Markdown text,
and a preview area which shows the md parsed as HTML. For the parsing it uses
the [Marked library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).
